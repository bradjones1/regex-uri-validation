# Regex URI Validation

A licensed repo for http://jmrware.com/articles/2009/uri_regexp/URI_regex.html

## Why this repository?

I ran across the above site while looking for regex URI validation, however it did not contain a license.

Reaching out to Jeff Roberson by e-mail, and he licensed it under MIT on Dec. 5, 2020. Excerpt:

```
YES! You may freely utilize any of the regex found in that article.  I normally release all my software under the MIT license which is very liberal
...
I'm pretty sure that allows you to re-license it under the GPL. However, I never specifically stated the licence on that article
...
Bottom line: Yes, you have my permission to use any of the regex found in that article.
```
